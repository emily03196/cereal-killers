["Decent neighborhood fast food restaurant. Food is OK. Service is fast. Pricing reasonably cheap.", "Great Resturant!  The Best resturant ever been to!", "Phenomenal grilled chicken on pita", "I've lowered my ranking of this restaurant. They sometimes screw up orders and there is one employee who always gets orders wrong and just hangs up the phone while ordering pickup. He's bad enough that I no longer ordering food from here.", "This is a classic \"Joint\" small, hot in the summer but the food is very good. Their burgers are fantastic, order the double cheese with Bacon. Awesome Chicago style Hot dogs too. Oh and don't let me forget the salads, very tasty. They have many items on the menu and they even deliver. I live 3 buildings north of them so it makes for a nice quick walk to get food. Once done, go next door to the Green Mill Jazz club. "]
