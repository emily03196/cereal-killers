By 4:45 the line waiting to get in was down the block.  \n\nAt 5, they let us in and the place immediately filled to capacity with a few people stuck outside waiting.   It is tiny but that's okay.  We sat down, ordered our beers (nice selection!) and a dozen oysters.   They go through a ton of oysters so it did not seem any had been sitting around.  We had three varieties and they were all very good.  There were some from Viriginia and the name escapes me but they were my favorite.   \n\nWe had another dozen and another round of beers.  The service was fairly quick and pretty friendly, although the bartender couldn't remember what we were drinking, but that wasn't a big deal.\n\nThis is a cool place with a nice, laid back vibe.

I would suggest coming here with a good friend and splitting all the tapas between the two of you so you can sample all the rich flavors.

I don't know why no one there understood our request. We just wanted soup. \n\nIf it was me, I would have said \"I am so sorry for the confusion. I will get that order in ASAP\" and i would personally go to the kitchen and try to get the soup myself. Instead we waited 45 min to get it. It's soup, takes 5 min. I would have cut other orders to fix the current problem. \n\nSo naturally I tipped extremely low and I hear the waitress bitching at another waiter about it. Sorry, but if you want a good tip, you provide good, attitude-less, service. \n\nI will never go here again.", "The drinks were very good.

They keep the temperature on a cooler side, and combined with music, the place has a night club vibe. The sushi was perfect, yet the ramen that we ordered for kids was a cacophony of mint, cilantro, wasabi, and other unbalanced flavours, however had a very flavourful short rib meat. They offer three types of desserts, and all of them were a delight.

She made every step seamless and easy, all the way down to the steaming of our table linens! Carissa had wonderful bartenders, chefs, and wait staff, my guests wanted to actually hire them for future parties. The event space was beautifully designed, with a very high tech sound system for our DJ, and a lovely outdoor garden space. The food was absolutely amazing!!

I would love to go back and try their other dishes.", "I went for dinner with my father and had a very plesant meal. We ordered the shrimp and grits and the crispy chicken and dumplings. The grits were to die for, absolutely melt in your mouth. Rich and creamy and left me wanting more. The shrimp and corn fritters that accompanied the grits were equally as delicious. The crispy chicken was cooked well and the skin on the outside was well seasoned and delicious. The dumplings could have used a splash more salt but were perfect with the yummy broth. We sat at the bar and the bar tender who served us was wonderful. Will definitely be back!", "Knife & Tine recently hosted us for a staff lunch and we could not be more impressed with the results.

The sauce was not a standard Hollandaise as is usual on a Benedict, but rather something much more citrusy and a perfect accompaniment to the salmon and the beautifully cooked eggs. Wedge potatoes had a strong herb flavor but were unremarkable.

Home to another James Beard Award for Best Restaurant Design and Best Restaurant Design Graphics. Named the Jean Banchet 2017 Restaurant of the Year. And of course, a one Michelin star restaurant.\n\nNoted for their Midwestern, farm-fresh cuisine, Blackbird is one of those restaurants that executes complex flavors in elegant dishes. This is probably not your average dine-out restaurant, given that most entrees are around $40. But if you're looking to impress, look no further. \n\nThe decor is minimalist and bright. Tables are crammed next to each other, which adds to the energy of the place. Service is impeccable; servers are always moving about swiftly and efficiently to serve and clear plates and utensils and to refill drinks. \n\nI've heard their prixe-fixe lunch menu is quite a bargain so for those strapped for cash but want to experience this Chicago staple, that may be the ticket.

If you want to get the wine pairing, it's $70 extra. For 10 courses, it may not be the most inexpensive meal but for what you're getting at a restaurant of exceptional caliber, it's a bargain. I have nothing but good things to say about each course. I especially liked the herbed chicken broth tea (which they bring out in a teapot and pour into glasses at your table) and the roasted squab with the pot pie.

I ordered fried turkey, but when I got home (45 minutes away  from the restaurant), I found myself enjoying goat sauce, that I never order in my life in any restaurant.\n\n3) They charge way too much for the food.  The only reason for that is because they don't have any competitors.  I spent 2 weeks vacation in Orlando, FL.  When I compare the price they charge in Haitian restaurant in Orlando and here, I think that's outrageous.  I don't expect the prices to be the same as in Orlando, because life in Chicago is a bit more expensive than Orlando, FL.

Very not traditional, with a ginger dipping sauce, but good.  Then the fish.  We had the butterfish, which is a signature dish for them, and the Chilean sea bass, which was a special.  Both amazing and highly recommended.  We finished our dinner with chai creme brulee with port soaked pears, again, very good.\n\nOur waiter.

The meat was moist with the most wonderful, satisfying favor. The seasoning had just the right note. And the skin formed the most perfect crispy treat. I ate the skin with my eyes closed and played with the texture in my mouth. It was briny and bursting with flavor. I could have eaten just that. The belly was so wonderful. I didn't want it to end. My dinner companion said he didn't know pork could be so divine. It was a family sized platter with three generous servings. Big enough to share. \n\nThe suckling pig wasn't the only wonderful thing we had. One of my favorite dishes here is the grilled octopus. I'm a grilled octopus connoisseur, so take my word for it: This is the best octopus in Chicago. It's tender and moist on the inside with just the right grilled finish to make each little suction cup yield in a fun way. It was braised with seasonings and finished on the grill without being the least bit burned. My guest commented that he had no finer grilled octopus on the coast of Spain and he concurred that it was probably Chicago's best. \n\nThe roasted brussels sprouts are my favorite side. You'll have to try them to understand why they are so special. \n\nI had the Barolo and my companion had the Chianti. The glasses of wine were generously sized just like the food. Ceres' Table is a wonderful value for the price, and a fantastic meal at any price. I was honestly surprised by how low my bill was considering the quality of the ingredients and the portion sizes. \n\nI cannot recommend Ceres' Table highly enough. I've also come for brunch many times and can tell you that they make perfect lobster benedict. In addition to the wonderful cuisine, the service at Ceres' Table is top notch. My favorite server is an elegant classical bassoonist named Karl who elevates the experience with his grace and charm. \n\nCeres' Table earns my highest review! You can have a wonderful meal with fantastic wines at a reasonable price with great service in a refined, unpretentious atmosphere.

Nutty flavor, perfectly cooked.  Wife had the Wet Aged \"Cowgirl Cut\", a little leaner than traditional Cowboy Cut, but both a great size.  For a side, we added the Mushroom Medley, but one of the most underrated parts was the 6 sauces, of which they brought all because we love sauces.  Each was really fun to pair with the beef.\n\nKinzie moved up to our #1 in the city Steakhouse, #2 best steak.

On the day of our reservation, we get there at 5:00 PM sharp. It was a Saturday and very busy so I was happy we had our reservation set. When reaching the welcome desk, we find out that our reservation was mistakenly made for 6:30 PM. This was too late as we were heading out to a venue after dinner.\n\nI tried to talk to the lady at the front desk and ask her to make some sort of arrangement as this was their fault. We were willing to wait a little. She just kept saying she would call us for our appointment at 6:30 PM. No attempt to resolve the situation was given. No one bothered to try and make accommodations or seemed to feel bad in any way for this poor service.\n\nWe left the place and went to Hub 51 instead which turned out amazing. \n\nTo top it all off, I received a text message notification at 7:15 PM that our table was finally ready at Ba-Ba-Reeba. \nNot only did they make a mistake in the time, but they were 45 mins late with the wrong reservation they had made to begin with.\nExtremely disappointing experience with this restaurant and I will not be going back for sure regardless of how good the food is reviewed to be.", "\u201cGreat for big group\u201d\nWe had dinner with 10 and sat at a long table in front of the restaurant.

I couldn't stop dipping bread in the juice.\n\nOysters were good, not amazing, but that might be because I ate a few forkful of their fettuccine with clams.

I asked her how I ordered it, and she remembered. She was great. Their chef ought to get canned.\n\nAlso, my steak knife was hardly what you would call clean.

I ordered the coconut and carrot soup for the first course, and really enjoyed it. It was thick, flavorful, and wasn't lacking in anything at all. Had the arctic char for my second course, but it was just okay. It came on a bed of some grain, I can never tell all those healthy grains apart, and was seasoned in a Moroccan spice style, with some cauliflower. For dessert, we shared the pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate sorbet. The pineapple upside down cake was pretty good, and definitely my favorite of the two. \n\nService was decent, but somewhat slow. I guess most people dining on Mag Mile during lunch are leisurely shopping and not on the lunch hour. It was fun to try out, but I don't think I'd go back.

By 9:30 we asked again and was told they needed another 20-30 minutes. That of course did not make me happy as we were 2 hours in and still could not get our meals for another 30 minutes.

We ended up getting a half and half because she didn't sell me on the McDowell. I don't remember what I got, I only remember her half being amazing!

The waiting area is quite small and inconveniently located directly in front of the to-go counter, but the rest of the restaurant is cozy and inviting with dim lighting, string lights, hip music, and candles. \n\nThe hostess quoted us 45 minutes for a table. I expressed that I'm visiting from out of town and we have all been eager to give the restaurant a try and she assured us the the wait was worth it, even pulling us over a few times to point out all of the different desserts we should try and sharing her favorites. They squeezed us in 15 minutes early at the end of their communal table. Score! Once seated, we got to work on the menu. \n\nWe ordered the Old Fashioned, Mexican, and Black & Tan hot chocolates. All were served with a delicious homemade marshmallow and were hits amongst the three of us except for the Black & Tan (1/3 hot fudge and 2/3 hot chocolate)... a bit to sweet for all of our liking. Our server was busy but still very attentive and just a delight. She backed up the suggestions for dessert and we ordered the bread pudding, chocolate cake, and cookie plate. All perfect compliments to our hot chocolate! The bread pudding was sweet and not too soggy (like others I've encountered) and the chocolate cake was beautifully served with cream poured over the top. The cookie plate was perfect for dunking into our hot chocolates and included one of each cookie offered in-house. Delicious! \n\nOn our way out, the hostess thanked us and wished me a safe trip back home (even remembering my name among all the chaos). I have worked in the service industry for over 12 years and I can appreciate great customer service and a staff who genuinely cares.

Was it outstanding? No.  Was the service great? No. Good wait staff? Yes but poor delivery coming from a number of areas from the kitchen and the barrister. At least 20 minutes for the Hot Chocolate. And that was after inquiring twice. When asked to cancel it, suddenly it appeared.  On the house in a go cup didn't allow the savor. Was anyone in charge? Even one meal came out separately.

She complained to the manager, who allowed him the substitute. The server's attitude was rude, apathetic, and condescending. I've experienced better customer service at McDonald's and many other places, and I'm not facetiously saying that.

After so many years, I suppose my anticipation was high, yet every single expectation was met and exceeded.\n\nFrom the moment the valet met us outside Tru's doors to when the host escorted us back to our car well past midnight, the service at Tru is impeccable. Never intrusive but always prompt, the staff's attentiveness hinted we were about to experience a special dining experience.

New dishes came out at ideal intervals allowing time in between for conversation and sips of wine.\n\nTru's wine list is vast and seemingly overwhelming, but the sommelier, obviously well versed in the cellar's holdings, made a flawless recommendation after asking us a few appropriate questions about our preferences. Furthermore, a cocktail I ordered was delicately mixed and we were delighted to find Tru carries one of our favorite mezcals.\n\nIt would have been a shame had the cuisine not matched the superb service, but no worries at all here. The caviar we sampled (Italian Royal ossetra) had a rich palate, was beautifully presented, and matched extremely well with the unfiltered sake we were recommended. Henceforth, we were treated to the varied profiles of Chef Anthony Martin's prix fixe menu. We found each successive dish to be a victory, but especially memorable for me was the butternut squash soup, smoked trout roe, duroc pork belly, quince champagne sorbet, the white truffle.\n\nSumming it all together, Tru proved absolutely unforgettable dining.

The server never asked us how we were or seemed to care that we were there.  The place was barely 1/3 full even by 6:30pm when we left.  So how is there any excuse for such absent and flaky service?  As far as the food, I was warned when I ordered the Kimono roll, that it would be REALLY spicy.  Really?  Spicy?  Spicy Nacho Doritos have tasted spicier.  It was bland, unexciting and fell apart often.  You may try to put on a trendy facade, Indie Cafe, but you didn't follow through with any positive experience.

Right after that another couple was seated at a table that was dirty, by that i mean it still had a half eaten burger on plate and other uneaten food as well as their drink ware, they left, as we should have. Unfortunately i did have to tip, 50 cents maybe but that was even too generous for the service we got, remember TIP is an acronym, its something earned, not given. But i did have to tip because i did not have exact change and we waited far too long for someone to come take our payment. 10-15 minutes went by where we didn't even see an employee so i left cash and we left.

The boneless wings were probably one of the worst tasting chicken wings I've had not just in Chicago, but in my life. Dull in flavor, the breading was flat and felt like cardboard. I mean, if I owned the place, I would be embarassed to even sell those things to the public. Now I can USALLY get passed the chicken (This time I couldn't) as long as an amazing sauce makes up for it. Here where the real disappointment came from....the sauce tasted ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like buffalo. It was like a tomato based sauce. I couldn't even imagine what something like that would taste good with but definitely not those wings. Shameful. The tomato paste (Lets not even call it buffalo sauce because it really isn't) did not even absorb through the breading (Or cardboard texture, if you will) and just hit the bottom of the plate. I literally almost laughed because I could not believe my eyes after reading such positive reviews. I ALMOST feel like whoever tried those boneless \"things\" should be entitled to a 100% refund.

Same with the Sarkana Carpaccio, a trio of tuna, octopus and salmon sashimi slices drizzled in a garlic chili sauce with capers and red and black masago, or smelt fish roe. And, when we feel like something warm and hearty, the Shrimp Toragashi, cooked shrimp in a special sauce does the trick. The sauce tastes so good with a rich blend of umami flavors and a little heat. \n\nThe service is warm and friendly. How the servers move with such ease in such a small place amazes me. We rarely have to wait to get our drinks refilled and they are good about clearing away plates when we switch from sushi to cooked entrees.  The high ceilings give a feeling of openness to the place that contrasts well with the dark paneling and neutral decor.

The \"crust\" at the bottom was as flimsy as paper and the top, although tasty and well-seasoned, resembled soup more than pizza. Although a family member recommended after the fact to dine during the week, the weekend rush should not have affected the quality of the product.

This costing more than that is outrageous enough because I could buy a bottle for the same price and drink it at home but I came for the event so nevertheless the rude bartender could have just said it in a polite way than being rude and almost disrespectful giving me dirty looks.

There is only one waiter but only 10 small tables, most of which were empty when we went so we expected a bit better service. We tried their miso ramen and spicy shin ramen. I enjoyed the miso ramen for the price, however my girlfriend is convinced the shin ramen is just a watered down version of the packaged Shin Ramen.

My sister in law asked for a table if 5 for us and she said it would be 5 minutes. My mother in law and my other two sister in laws asked us if we had asked for a table. They were making sure because they came from the restroom. I guess the girl thought they asked her and she was all moody and said it will be a few minutes while we clear off a table. She didn't have to be so rude. I wish we left at this point. \nOur waiter was also in a bad mood... We all split dishes except for myself because I wanted some leftovers for the next day. My mother in law and sister in law ordered wine. My sister in laws wine was Chardonnay and she said it tasted terrible! Then we order our expensive food. Two girls split the vodka sauce with chicken and two girls split spaghetti and meatballs. I also ordered that. It was a big plate, but for a simple dish to be $26 is crazy. That was the least expensive dish too. It was nothing special. My mom makes better spaghetti with jar sauce and she can't even cook well. I tasted the vodka sauce dish and it was better, but still not a $30 dish. No one got refills except my mother in law and sister in law because they had alcohol. We had to split the bill amongst us and it took a little bit because we wanted to make sure we all pitched in what we owe. After we were heading out the waiter counted the money right in front of us!

French  fries  were soggy and no one ate them. For a steak house I'd suggest  steak  fries with some body to them. Broccoli  was just under cooked, could only chew the crowns.

I really enjoyed the pan seared salmon, which had impeccable presentation-- zucchini puree smeared on the plate with the salmon placed on top, and the fingerling potatoes placed in a precise fashion around the plate, filled with the olive tapenade. Only gripe was that I didn't enjoy the tapenade, but I knew that going in that I don't enjoy olives. I just didn't want to be difficult and ask for them to skip it. \n\nJust a heads up that the black angus sliders were a lot smaller than I was expecting-- also you only get two of them, so it's only a good shared plate if you have two people...

Here you get free chips, but then pay $4 PER salsa, oh and the salsa dishes are small. We ordered the medium salsa and our waitress brought us the mild (green one) we ordered the red salsa.

It was divine.  I highly recommend it for any cheese lovers. For the main course I ordered the Gnocchi and the mushrooms steak. The Gnocchi was made extremely well. The flavor was top notch and it was accompanied by cranberries. The mushroom steak was different but still good. The mushroom itself was hard to cut and had a slight rubbery texture for the first couple bites but it was full of flavor so it made up for it.  It came with roasted carrots, spinach, and fried potatoes.  I was a bit worried at the portion size as it seemed a little small but after the meal I was perfectly content,  not overly full and ready for the dessert. For dessert I ordered the sorbet and the chocolate cake.  This was probably the highlight of the meal. I mean, I love desserts but this was AMAZING.  The cake was baked perfectly. The sorbet has 6 different choices to choose from. I ordered the passion fruit, chocolate, and Cynthia suprised me with the 3rd which was the vanilla because I'm indecisive. Needless to say the dessert plates were left empty.  Overall experience was 9.1 out of 10. I'll definitely be coming back again soon. Thank you for the wonderful service, food and atmosphere.

The manager (who's name I did not catch but he was wearing a Cubs cap) was also sincerely apologetic and offered us a round of drinks on the house!

When I was finally able to get to the door, the rude ass lady at the door exclaimed that there was a mandatory food and beverage minimum of $25.00 for women and $45.00 for men. She said that you get it back on a gift card that you can spend on anything they sell. That's extortion, it's ridiculous and it's strike one. Strike two is when I told her that I on a list for a party, she had a guy come over to check a list and then said that my friend had not arrived yet so we had to wait for her since she ordered bottle service or we had to pay to go in. That's strike three would be when I found out they had a mandatory coat check, which is not a big deal because I was going to check it anyway but I don't like being told I have to so something as a customer who is volunteering to put my hard earned dollars in your pocket.

There were people coming and going, and it was impossible to have a real conversation.  The restaurant was obviously overbooked, with customers jammed, especially near our table.  The food was good but not worth the uncomfortable experience.

Some friends of ours were in town visiting, and we thought this place would be perfect for the occasion. Google considers it a \"romantic\" restaurant, so we were expecting a nice, quiet vibe. That was not the case at all, as the place was an absolute mad house from the moment we walked in.\nWe had reservations at 8:30 and were seated about 15 minutes late- not a big deal. We received waters and their fresh baked bread, which was absolutely amazing! We ordered our food promptly and couldn't wait to try our Mediterranean dishes. Unfortunately, it had been storming all night- absolutely pouring! Our waitress, after we waited an hour for our food, finally apologized and said that all the reservations came in at the same time because of the storm. This was just poor, slow service, in my opinion, being blamed on the customers coming in at the same time. It is my feeling that reservations are exactly that, so if guests arrived late for their reservation, why would they be given priority still when some of us did arrive on time? \nAll in all, I knocked off 2 stars due to the experience. The restaurant was crazy loud to the point where we could hardly hear our friends at the small table across from us and staff members were running all over the place. The food was the only saving grace here. Our meals were delicious and filling, but I only wish we hadn't waited over an hour to receive it.

They said they would only give us half our money back for the wings or would have to bring us another order.

Our other complaint was that we asked for bread and was told they ran out due to two parties earlier and the kitchen didn't want to make more because it was late. It was at least 40 minutes before closing. When we spoke to the manager he told us that there was indeed bread, the kitchen had made it several minutes back and he offered to bring some to our table.

Two appetizers started things off to a fantastic start; stuffed shrimp and crepe style stuffed with shrimp I think. Yum yum and yum, will go back for both.  Incredibly good Pho broth, lots of noodles, another yum.  We had the special beefsteak.  A true sign of a restaurant is how they handle an unhappy customer.  The beek came out way too salty.  I asked the waitress to ask the chef to taste and if that was the seasoning and salt level it was too much for me.  Couldn't of been nicer, two additional staff came by and apologized.  They remade the dish and I tasted why it is one of their top dishes.  Vegetarians try the eggplant, so tasty and a complete meal.  This is not a corner stop in, definitely higher end Vietnamese food.  I will return.", "High end Vietnamese food, with a beautiful dining room.  Quality service and reasonably priced dishes.  The surprising stars were the desserts - one of the best fried banana/ice cream combo we ever had.", "We are Vietnamese from DC, in Chicago for a family reunion. We stayed downtown but because we wanted to support a Vietnamese establishment we drove 7 miles in congested Labor Day weekend traffic out to this restaurant that seemed very promising from the high review score. In hindsight, I should have noted the low number of reviews. The six of us that included two hungry young children arrived around 7.10pm. We were greeted warmly at the door and walked into an almost empty but large seating area. I thought the host was a bit clueless as she would walk quietly behind us so we did not really know where she wanted to sit us. My wife was carrying my sleeping 5 year old son and the same hostess proceeded to take the 6th chair away which again was a red flag. Did she expect my wife to carry the child through the dinner? Water was served quickly but only for 4 of the 6 people. We had to ask the waitress for more water. But we were happy to see familiar dishes on the menu.\n\nWe ordered a variety of traditional Vietnamese dishes noticing that the price was on the high end. By 7.25 all orders were in and I made a special request that since the kids were very hungry that their food come out quickly. Almost 20 minutes later two appertizers came out. The tempura shrimps were enveloped in super thick batter and sure enough the flour is still uncooked in the inside. The banh xeo, an easy but endearing Vietnamese dish, was burnt in the outside but also uncooked inside. We did not recognize some of the accompanying vegetables or the way the dish was presented as authentic Vietnamese. We asked to return the shrimp dish (3 of the 4 shrimps left.) Then we sat there and waited patiently for our other dishes, one of which is pho, which any good Vietnamese restaurant would be able to bring out in 10 minutes or less. But not this one.\n\nBy 8.10, almost an hour after we'd arrived, there was no food on the table. Everybody was hungry and wondering what was going on. We finally asked our waitress who went to the kitchen to check and came back saying food would be forthcoming in two minutes. Five minutes later there was no food still. There were only two other tables besides ours. I asked my family to stand up to leave - the first time ever in my life as a foodie to have walked out of a restaurant because of poor food or service. We left a $20 on the table so the poor waittress would still get something for her time.\n\nWe felt angry, cheated even. This place, branding itself as an upscale Vietnamese place, does not even cook Vietnamese food. The favorable reviews scream fake to me after having seen and tasted how food is cooked in the most amateurish way possible. As such, despite the fancy decor and uniform, I predict a long and painful death for this place. I suggest that potential customers stay far away from it."], "I Monelli Trattoria Pizzeria": ["This is the BEST. After coming here, there is literally no point in going anywhere else for Italian food.", "tiny place with greay food.. started and contiues to be pizza delivery.. ", "This place has gone down the toilet, unfortunately. It used to have decent pizza. The rest of the menu was always weak, but pizza was ok--until recently when it turned into inedible blobs of...just grossness. Do yourself a favor: Just skip this place.\n\nSo what happened? We used to get delivery from Monelli every couple of months of so for years now. Then recently two bad things happened. First time it got here incredibly late, waited an hour and twenty minutes. One of the pizzas did not have the mushrooms we asked for, not to mention it was cold. We called to complain, only to get a shockingly rude guy on the phone who just kept saying \"it was delivered on time.\" Totally ignored everything else. Should have known it was a bad sign... A couple of months later, we tried again to give them a second chance -- only to get inedible squares of uncooked dough, wilted arugula, and slates of half-melted cheese.  Now, everyone has had bad pizza, but this was special -- quite disgusting.  Have you tried eating uncooked dough? Topped with half-melted cheese? \n\nWhen we called to complain, the employee took our info down, said manager would call back. He never called back. When we called again tomorrow, the employee said the manager is busy, no refunds, no re-delivery. What??!  After a third time, the manager picked up the phone, only to keep repeating, \"I'm sorry to hear that, but our policy is no refunds, no re-delivery.\" Asking what kind of policy is that, he said they've been getting a lot of \"he said, she said\" complaints, so they can do nothing for their ungrateful customers. The only part I'm sure about is that they must be receiving a lot of complaints while pocketing the money, for now -- not sure how long they will remain open or be closed down for a health inspection sooner or later.\n\nIn short -- Avoid this place like the plague: the food is gross and the management is worse.  (If you're wondering where we get our pizza now: Sie Pie, Homeslice, Andiamo -- Monelli never again!)", "I want to love it.  We might not give it another try, though.  The food was actually really good.  That wasn't the problem.  We waited over an hour for our food to come out.  In that hour, our water wasn't refreshed and we weren't offered extra bread.  Our kids sat there with nothing to do.  It was an excruciating wait.  At the hour point, I went up to the server and the man who I assume was the owner and asked how much longer they expected it to take.  The owner completely ignored me and the server came back and said, \"It shouldn't be too much longer.\"  15 minutes later we had our food.  Again, the food tasted good, but my lasagna came out cold.  That added another 15 minutes to our wait as they heated it up.  Finally, after almost two hours at the restaurant, we were leaving, but not before a 10 minute wait for our check.  In summary, good food, bad service and the bad definitely outweighed the good.", "If I could give this a lower rating than 1 star I would.  The service is beyond slow and the staff is rude.\n\nI went to this establishment with my wife and a few friends.  We started by ordering salads and apps individually and they came out family style.  This wouldn't typically be a problem but the waitress didn't bring out any plates or serving utensils.  After waiting for easily 10 mins we received the place settings.\n\nNext we ordered the main course.  Some ordered pizza while others ordered pasta dishes.  I, myself ordered the lasagna, big mistake on my part.  We waited about 35-40 mins before the pizzas started to come out of the kitchen.  It was an additional 40 minutes for the pasta dishes to be delivered.  Everyone in the group had there food except me.  It was another 30 minutes before my lasagna was served.  I took one bite and found it was still cold.  Are you kidding me?

After getting another roll of the eyes from the waitress, the manager came to the table angry and when asked to cook the appetizer a little more he refused too. \nAfter asking the waitress five time to please sing \"happy birthday\" to my little one, of course we got one more eye roll. \nI wish I could give them zero stars!\n\nI have traveled around the world and have been in many restaurants but I have never experienced this level of disrespect ever!"], "Mariposa": ["Since it is so bitter cold, we opted to eat in the hotel.

It\u2019s particularly delightful when it\u2019s warm enough to eat on the terrace, a surprisingly serene environment considering it\u2019s just a half dozen or so floors above Michigan Avenue.\n\nWe put ourselves in our waiter\u2019s hands, and he assembled a delightful multi-course meal for us.\n\nWe began with an assortment of six pieces of dim sum, individually plated for each of us. This item is not listed on the menu (nor is any form of dim sum sampler) so it is worth asking about. Although I am not a huge dim sum fan, this was clearly the best I have ever had; each was light and flavorful, and even the crab rangoon managed to be delicate and appealing.\n\nNext we shared a split serving of hot and sour soup, also the best I\u2019ve had, with less vinegar and more broth flavor. Plenty of tender lobster chunks made it special.\n\nPeking duck is available in a full or half portion, and the half is perfect for sharing as an appetizer. It\u2019s served with the traditional cucumber, scallions, pancakes and sauces, but the duck was so perfect we ate most of it by itself. Crispy skin and no layer of fat at all made it among the best duck dishes I\u2019ve had. Next time I might try the five spice duck to compare it.\n\nFor entrees we shared scallops in black truffle sauce, and a spicy shrimp dish. Both were good, and were different from anything else we\u2019d had, but I felt the preceding courses were better.\n\nPerhaps the highlight of the meal was an amazing red rice dish that I didn\u2019t see on the menu. It was vegetarian, and included various nuts, broccoli and other tidbits, and had a rich, mouth-filling flavor that was remarkable. I would definitely ask for this again.\n\nFinally we finished with a fruit and sorbet plate. Our waiter added a bit of coconut sorbet, which turned out to be the highlight.\n\nA well-conceived wine list offers many selections designed to accompany the food, including a small half bottle section. Wine prices are erratic, with some barely above retail, and others sky high, so careful browsing is required, but will be rewarded.\n\nThis was a great meal, and I\u2019m sure we will return often to this surprising oasis in the midst of the city.", "Disappointing \nMost of the dim sum we had this lunchtime were good but not the best. The Peking Duck without crispy (or separated) skin, General Tso chicken with a congealed sauce, disappearing staff.

There are over 7000 wineries in America, and while some of them are owned by big corporations most of them are smaller and family owned.

The fries were salted just right and came with a whiskey BBQ sauce that really tasted like it was made on the spot. The sausage was all beef and tasted as good as you might expect. It came with a seasoned pickle i had an enjoyable bite of and put on the side (after all there was fresh relish). I was good after the dog which was meaty and satisfying but figured I might not be back and went for a unique dessert. If you're into such things, but only if you are more into the experience and sight of such artistry, would I recommend this dessert: corn profiterole.

The prices were really good for Japanese food. We had edamame, tempura combo, and the ribeye with asparagus maki as appetizers. Edamame and Tempura were fresh and hot! The ribeye was unique and flavorful! A bit of spice on the top with the sweet teriyaki and a nice twist! We also had the crunch roll which was so delightful we got two. The other member in my party got the Umi roll and  enjoyed hers as well! The miso soup was hot and slightly salty which is nice. My daughter (1 yr) had chicken teriyaki and gobbled it up!

I find the appetizers, sides and the service of the staff to be about the quality that one would expect at an Outback Steakhouse, not horrible but not high quality either. What Carmichaels lacks in customer service and quality and taste of side dishes, their Delmonico rib-eye steak more than makes up for any negative review I might write, that steak is the best steak I have had in Chicago or anywhere else for that matter. The steak is not listed on their website menu but it is a \"special\" listed in the restaurant on their board but their specials rarely change and I have been able to order every time I have been to the restaurant.\n\nAlso be wary, they do have a tendency to slightly overcook the steak as well, something you would not expect from a great steakhouse. Just keep all this in mind when going, the steak when done the way you want is fabulous! ", "Outstanding service.  Outstanding food.  Outstanding drinks. This place did it up, real good.  I got the KC Bone-in Strip. Delicious. My girl got the Lobster tail ( how can you go wrong with that?) it was HUGE and really tasty. Appetizer, I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna.  Big large pieces of tuna that melt in your mouth.  Also, get the Au Gratin potatoes for a side.  Cheesy and really tasty.  I did not sit outside, but next time that will be my spot.

My brother devoured a huge-ass steak and laid waste to the bread basket and cheese spread. Usually talkative, he was way too busy eating to make smalltalk. Fine by me, as the tenderloin sliders I had were fantastic. Cooked perfectly rare, ridiculously tender -- just the way they should be.\n\nThe broccoli was good, though the sauce entirely unnecessary. Though our server stopped by once to see if everything was okay, it seemed awful perfunctory. To her credit, she asked if we were attending a game at the UC, and we were, so she made suggestions that would fit within our time budget.\n\nPreviously, a server had taken time to explain the various cuts of meat and offer some suggestions from the specials board.

I was excited to have dinner at Mastro's and the whole evening for NYE. When we got to Mastro's at 6:00pm. The table was ready and we ordered a bottle of wine, a French onion soup right away. We also decided to share one order of New York steak. We didn't want to be too heavy for dancing. The steak was perfect and so was the atmosphere. Everything was good. After dinner, we got the bill.  Although the bill seemed too pricey, we couldn't verify it with no itemized bill included. We figured we would take a look at it later. We paid quickly and left at 7:40pm to go to the show. We had a wonderful NYE. After the holiday, we called Mastro's and requested the itemized bill. After a couple more calls, we finally got the itemized bill. Reviewing it, we found several items that we hadn't ordered were listed on the bill. It included one extra steak, two more cocktails and a salad, totaling $91 overcharged. Thank god that they have a time stamp on orders. They were all ordered at 7:21pm. We would have finished the dinner by then and ready to leave. Obviously, it was an error. It could happen. It was understandable, however the way the staff handled the issue was beyond my expectation. It was unprofessional and unpleasant experience in any Five Star restaurants I have ever been to. When we told the assistant manager that it was an error, her voice and tone changed. She said that she would have to talk to the waiter, she'd have to figure out who will have to pay, etc. We had to listen to her in a brusque whiny voice. Well, it wasn't exactly the customer's issue, was it?  Then, she told us to call back. We called again to follow up, we ended up getting the same run around- Well, I dunno, we haven't yet talked to the waiter, GM would have to approve it, etc.  After a few more calls, we were finally told that GM had approved to refund the mistake portion of the bill. After making several calls and wasting a few days, now we were finally getting the refund.  Yeah...really?  It is also equally disappointing that no apology was offered from the restaurant. One courtesy call would have been enough for keeping me as a returning customer. It would have been enough for me to forget such mistakes, such run arounds, or such a whiny voice.  No apology or courtesy call. so, I am giving \"4\" for food but \"0\" point for customer service. I expect more professionalism from a reputable restaurant.
